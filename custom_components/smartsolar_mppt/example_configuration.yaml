# Example configuration for SmartSolar MPPT Integration
# This file shows how the integration would appear in configuration.yaml
# In practice, you should use the UI configuration flow instead

# Example of how sensors would appear (auto-generated by integration):
# sensor:
#   - platform: smartsolar_mppt
#     name: "SmartSolar MPPT Device"
#     username: "your_username"
#     password: "your_password"
#     mode: "device"  # or "project"
#     device_type: 2  # 1 for Sun-GTIL2, 2 for Mạnh Quân
#     chipset_ids: ["your_chipset_id"]

# Example of manual service call:
# service: smartsolar_mppt.refresh_token
# data:
#   entry_id: "your_config_entry_id"

# Example of logging configuration for debugging:
# logger:
#   logs:
#     custom_components.smartsolar_mppt: debug
